# 1. the purpose of this project is to make an user management system that can create, update, edit, delete, and a functional UI using angular as frontend and node.js for backend. This will help us prepare for challenges that come to us.

# 2. The installation command i use is npm install but it gets error so i use the npm install --legacy-peer-deps to install the angular foundational dependencies. the running command is ng serve or ng serve --open

# 4.  the testing in backend is ok but in the email part is it has error it says the value is invalid and for the frontend no testing has been done because the code has a lot of errors in the code provided and i didnt fix it on time eventhough ive been fixing it for 4 days now.

# 5. for a good branching and commting , best practice for this is committing little by little every work you have done and dont push all files at once.  pull request is done only when its finish debugging, etc.
