# 1. the purpose of this project is to make an user management system that can create, update, edit, delete, and a functional UI using angular as frontend and node.js for backend. This will help us prepare for challenges that come to us.

# 2. The installation command i use is npm install but it gets error so i use the npm install --legacy-peer-deps to install the angular foundational dependencies. the running command is ng serve or ng serve --open

# 4.  The testing in the backend is successful and didnt encounter any problem at all. the securirt testing result for now in the backend is the token where 1. you cannot successfully verify your email without the token 2. also you cant easily change password without the jwToken.

# 5. for a good branching and commting , best practice for this is committing little by little every work you have done and dont push all files at once.  pull request is done only when its finish debugging, etc.
